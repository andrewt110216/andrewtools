## Examples

## Progress Bar

If you are working on a program that uses a loop that takes a significant amount of time to execute, it can be nice to follow the progress of your program while it runs. Use `print_progress_bar` to visualize the progress via the command line.

```
import time
from andrewtools import print_progress_bar

iterations = 10
for i in range(iterations):
    print_progress_bar(i, iterations, width=10, prefix="Progress")
    time.sleep(0.5)

# Printed to standard out:
Progress | ***------- | 30%  <- % and progress bar update in-place while loop runs
```

- Note: this function will not play well if you're loop includes other print statements.
